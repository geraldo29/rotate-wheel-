Project 2: 
After running, a frame will appear. Here you will see a wheel, speedometer, an empty fuel tank, a revolution counter, system controller, an empty fuel meter, and a button to add gas. 
The wheel will be off. To turn on the wheel, first add how much gas as you want. Then you will move your mouse to the system controller where you will see a rectangle. Here you will left click your mouse on top of this rectangle and drag the rectangle to start the wheel. 
You will be able to control the speed of the wheel from very slow to very fast (left to right). After the wheel starts turning you will see that the fuel tank and fuel meter will start decreasing. The revolution counter will start incrementing after each rotation. The speedometer needle will start moving depending on the speed of the wheel. 
If you want to add more gas, you will be able to by right clicking the "Press to add Gas" button on the bottom of the system controller. By pressing this rectangle, you will increment the fuel tank and the fuel meter. 
If you have no more gas, the wheel will stop, with the speedometer returning to zero, and the system controller turning off. The revolution counter will let you know how many times it rotated. To reset the counter, please run the program again.
